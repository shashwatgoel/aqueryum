One thing we realized was that coding affects testing and maintenance. Coding was a colossal step in itself but even bigger was actually to sit down and test the system developed coupled with its maintenance. As testing and maintenance costs are high, aim of our coding activity was to write code that reduces them.

Hence, goal should not be to reduce coding cost, but testing and maintenance cost, i.e. make the job of tester and maintainer easier
We tried to write as easy a code as possible because different members had different roles viz. - coders, maintainers, developers, testers ; and had to go through the code many a times.


== COMMON GOAL ==
  #  Minimize effort
  #  Minimize size
  #  Minimize memory
  #  Maximize clarity
  #  Maximize output clarity
